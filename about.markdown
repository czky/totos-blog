Hello there! I'm Thomas-Andrei Zareczky, a student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. I'm majoring in Automatics and I'm absolutely fascinated by it!

When I'm not buried in my books, you can find me playing basketball, video games, or trying to find better ways to increase my productivity.

I believe in lifelong learning and I'm always up for a new adventure! You can reach me at [zareczky@proton.me](mailto:zareczky@proton.me).

Thanks for stopping by!
