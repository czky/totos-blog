In this wild world of **digital chaos**, your privacy is **not** a lost cause - it's a **treasure** waiting to be snatched back. Why should you care? Because privacy isn't just about keeping your embarrassing selfie collection secret (*maybe that too*). It's about **power**, information is **gold** in this age. When reading news, seeking directions or **anything else**, you are relying on information. Just like ![Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) says: *"If we live in an information society, our information matters, and therefore privacy matters."*.

## What exactly is Privacy?
Even though *privacy* can go hand inhand with *anonymity* and *security*, we can't get them confused. They overlap, creating a sweet spot for most of the people.
- Privacy is being sure that **your** data is only seen by who **you** want to see it. (eg. end-to-end encryption in instant messengers)
- Anonimity is the ability to act **without being identifiable**. (eg. ![Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/))
- Security is the **trust** you put into the applications you use and into the **parties** that *say* they will keep those applications **safe**. (eg. ![HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS))

## Control = Privacy?
Yes and no. It sounds simple and appealing (*maybe too simple*) but it doesn't really work in practice.
Let's do a simple imagination exercise.
- You enter on a website,
- One little cute pop-up shows up,
- You read it,
- It's talking about some ![cookies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/),
- Some checkboxes spread around the pop-up make you feel like you have a choice,
- You uncheck some of them and read the article you wanted to read.

Now imagine it happening **10-20 times per day**, will you read all of the pop-ups? I can't speak for all of you, but I can tell you that I won't waste my time with that pop-up on every website I visit.

## Privacy by Design
So, the point is, we need privacy to be built into the *apps and services* we use, **not pop-ups**. Trying to make an app more private on our own is too complicated, but if we can have access to the privacy we need by default, it's a lot easier. This idea is called **privacy by design**, and it suggests that privacy should be integrated into the technology we use right from the beginning, *no settings adjusted*.

As we talk about privacy, there are also **rules**, like the ![GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) in *Europe*. Those rules are there to make sure companies respect our privacy, some of the rules working better than the others. :wink:

## Conclusion
In the end, making privacy simple means finding the balance between **making things easy to understand** (*like my blog, hopefully*) and **giving control to users**. Everyone needs to work together to make sure privacy is seen as a **must-have** and a **basic and clear part** of our digital world.
